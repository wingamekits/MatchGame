##Description

The Match Game Starter Kit is a Construct 2 game template for a simple touch-based game through which players have to match text items to a corresponding image. You supply a set of images, the text to match it, and the game engine automatically randomizes the board for each execution of the game.

**Note: this template is optimized for Windows 8. Updates are planned to improve the experience for both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8**
